The game is simple. Help Sohan to avoid his Archenemy, none other than Deepika Padukone. Legend says that one of Sohan's mates (definitely not me) cursed Sohan.
The Curse bounds sohan to the sky realm being constantly bombarded with Orbs of Deepika. And if he touches any one of them, he dies in a dramatic explosion. Sad.

So, help Sohan to survive his curse, and in the process, maybe beat the high score.

The game has many fun and engaging features.
1. Retro sounds and animations.
2. Score tracker to compete with friends.
3. Multiple lives, which increase upon drinking Sohan's favourite drink, Boost. (In Progress)

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to move around the sky realm
2. Collect Boost Energy Drinks and avoid Deepika.
3. Enjoy!!
